<h3>Instructions</h3>
<div id="info" class="placeholder I">
  You will be analyzing parts of an addressbook policy. An addressbook policy defines how names and addresses are stored and looked up in an address book. Statements from the policy are shown below, along with some examples. Some of the examples are consistent with the statements' meanings. Others are not. Please mark which examples are consistent (green) or inconsistent (red) by clicking on them.
</div>

<h3>Statements</h3>
<b>Changes since the last task have been highlighted</b>
<ol class="I">
	<li>The addressbook policy involves targets listed in the book.</li>
	<li>A target is either a name (like 'Bob') or an address (like '102 Rose Way').</li>
  <li>Every name is an entry in the book.</li>
  <li>Every entry in the book has exactly one target listing.</li>
  <li style="background-color:#aaf">No name is listed in it's own lookup. To look up a name, one follows each target listing to the eventual address.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="placeholder">Counterexample and Spec Tracing</h2>

<p class="placeholder">
  The experiment will have you complete several specification tracing tasks. In each task you will see an alloy specification, an assertion intended to be true about the specification, and some counterexamples: scenarios that show why the assertion is not true. You will be asked to edit the specification to make the assertion true.<br/>
  If you have any questions, concerns, or frustratons, you'll be able to let us know at the end of the experiment.

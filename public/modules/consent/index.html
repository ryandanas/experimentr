<h2 class="placeholder">Specification Refinements</h2>

<p class="placeholder">
  The experiment will have you complete several specification refinement tasks. In each task you will see a specification, a set of goals intended to be satisfied by the specification, and an example where one of the goals is not satisfied. You will be asked to make a single change to the specification so that all of our goals are satisfied.</p>

  I understand that the following task is voluntary, and I may stop at any time. 
  I am aware that my job will only be accepted if I complete the entire task and enter the confirmation code on Mechanical Turk. 
  I understand this study should take less than 10 minutes. I know I can contact the requesters if it took much longer than the estimated time and I do not feel adequately compensated.

(Alice is listed under Bob. Bob is listed under Room 503. A lookup of Alice goes from Alice to Bob, then Bob to Room 503.) You also clearly stated that a number cannot have an entry.  So, how could Bob be under 503? Don't you mean that 503 is listed under Bob? Then you said that there can be only one location per entry. So, according to your example, Bob is under Alice and 503 is under Bob, as I understand it. I was confused by the previous example that said that ""Room 503 can be listed under Alice. Bob can be listed under Alice (meaning Alice has moved to Bob's listed location)."" This sounded like 2 entries under Alice, but I now see that you meant those to be 2 different examples.  This was why it took me a while to get the first example. Also, I am still confused at the last question in the first part. You said that a name cannot have an entry and each entry can have only one location and then say that a name can be under a name under a number. This seems contradictory. "

So, how could Bob be under 503? Don't you mean that 503 is listed under Bob? Then you said that there can be only one location per entry. So, according to your example, Bob is under Alice and 503 is under Bob, as I understand it. I was confused by the previous example that said that ""Room 503 can be listed under Alice. Bob can be listed under Alice (meaning Alice has moved to Bob's listed location)."" This sounded like 2 entries under Alice, but I now see that you meant those to be 2 different examples.  This was why it took me a while to get the first example. Also, I am still confused at the last question in the first part. You said that a name cannot have an entry and each entry can have only one location and then say that a name can be under a name under a number. This seems contradictory. "
